...is an open ISO-standardized language. 
For a time, C++ had no official standard and was maintained by a de-facto standard, however since 1998, C++ is standardized by a committee of the ISO. Their page may be accessed here. 

...is a compiled language. 
C++ compiles directly to a machine's native code, allowing it to be one of the fastest languages in the world, if optimized. 

...is a strongly-typed unsafe language. 
C++ is a language that expects the programmer to know what he or she is doing, but allows for incredible amounts of control as a result. 

...supports both manifest and inferred typing. 
As of the latest C++ standard, C++ supports both manifest and inferred typing, allowing flexibility and a means of avoiding verbosity where desired. 

...supports both static and dynamic type checking. 
C++ allows type conversions to be checked either at compile-time or at run-time, again offering another degree of flexibility. Most C++ type checking is, however, static. 

...offers many paradigm choices. 
C++ offers remarkable support for procedural, generic, and object-oriented programming paradigms, with many other paradigms being possible as well. 

...is portable. 
As one of the most frequently used languages in the world and as an open language, C++ has a wide range of compilers that run on many different platforms that support it. Code that exclusively uses C++'s standard library will run on many platforms with few to no changes. 

...is upwards compatible with C 
C++, being a language that directly builds off C, is compatible with almost all C code. C++ can use C libraries with few to no modifications of the libraries' code. 

...has incredible library support. 
A search for "library" on the popular project-management website SourceForge will yield over 3000 results for C++ libraries. A link to the results of the search may be found here.
